# DataStructure

This repository is dedicated to enhancing my knowledge and skills in Data Structures. Here, I will document various implementations, algorithms, and concepts related to data structures, as well as practical exercises and projects to reinforce learning.

## Overview

Data structures are fundamental to computer science and software development. This repository contains implementations and examples of:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms

Each section includes detailed explanations and code implementations, along with sample problems to apply the concepts.

## Features

- Step-by-step implementations with comments
- Examples of real-world applications
- Practice problems and solutions
- Code written with readability and efficiency in mind

## Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Primarily C (may include others like Python or Java depending on the topic)
- **Tools**:
  - Code Editor: VSCode
  - Compiler: GCC/Clang

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
DataStructure/
├── LinkedLists/
├── Stacks/

```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/J41R0JUNIOR/DataStructure.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the specific folder for the data structure or algorithm you wish to explore.
3. Compile and run the example codes:
   ```bash
   gcc example.c -o example
   ./example
   ```
